# SpellCast Survivors - Implementation Guide

## üéØ Current Status: FOUNDATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ

The core foundation of SpellCast Survivors has been implemented! You now have a working Game scene with all the essential systems in place.

## üìÅ Files Created

### Scripts
- `/scripts/Game.gd` - Main game manager with state handling
- `/scripts/Player.gd` - Player movement and stats (WASD controls)
- `/scripts/SpellManager.gd` - Spell queuing and typing system
- `/scripts/EnemyManager.gd` - Enemy spawning and difficulty scaling

### Scenes
- `/scenes/Game.tscn` - Main game scene with complete UI layout

### Configuration
- Updated `project.godot` with WASD movement input map

## üéÆ How to Test the Current Implementation

1. **Open the project in Godot Editor**
2. **Open the Game scene**: `/scenes/Game.tscn`
3. **Run the scene** (F6 or click "Play Scene")

### What Works Right Now:
- ‚úÖ **Player Movement**: Use WASD or arrow keys to move the blue rectangle
- ‚úÖ **Camera Following**: Camera smoothly follows the player
- ‚úÖ **UI Elements**: Health bar, XP bar, and spell slots are visible
- ‚úÖ **Spell Queuing**: Press number keys 1-6 to queue spells
- ‚úÖ **Typing System**: Start typing after queuing a spell (time slows down!)
- ‚úÖ **Pause System**: Press ESC to pause/unpause the game
- ‚úÖ **Game States**: PLAYING, PAUSED states are functional

### Current Spell List:
1. **bolt** (4 chars) - 10 damage
2. **ice blast** (9 chars) - 20 damage  
3. **fireball** (8 chars) - 25 damage
4. **lightning** (9 chars) - 30 damage
5. **meteor** (6 chars) - 35 damage
6. **time warp** (9 chars) - 40 damage

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete the Game

### Immediate Priorities (Essential for Gameplay)

#### 1. Create Enemy System
```
Create: /scenes/Enemy.tscn
- CharacterBody2D with collision
- Health component
- AI behavior (move toward player)
- Visual representation (red ColorRect)
```

#### 2. Implement Spell Effects
```
Create: /scenes/spells/ directory
- Bolt.tscn (projectile)
- IceBlast.tscn (area effect)
- Fireball.tscn (explosive projectile)
- Lightning.tscn (instant line)
- Meteor.tscn (delayed area)
- TimeWarp.tscn (utility spell)
```

#### 3. Add Auto-Attack System
```
Modify: /scripts/Player.gd
- Add auto-attack timer
- Create Mana Bolt projectiles
- Target nearest enemy
```

#### 4. Implement Damage System
```
Create: /scripts/Health.gd
- Health component for enemies and player
- Damage calculation
- Death handling
```

### Secondary Features (Polish & Balance)

#### 5. Level Up System
```
Create: /scenes/LevelUpScreen.tscn
- Spell upgrade options
- Stat improvements
- UI for selection
```

#### 6. Visual Effects
```
Create: /scenes/effects/ directory
- Particle systems for spells
- Screen shake on impacts
- Damage numbers
```

#### 7. Audio System
```
Add: Sound effects and music
- Spell casting sounds
- Enemy damage/death
- Background music
```

## üõ† Implementation Tips

### Working with the Existing Code

1. **Game Manager Pattern**: The `Game.gd` script is your central hub
   - Add new systems as child nodes
   - Use signals to communicate between systems
   - Update game state through `change_state()`

2. **Spell System Integration**:
   - The `SpellManager` handles all typing logic
   - Connect to `spell_cast` signal to create actual spell effects
   - Time dilation is already implemented (slows to 20% during typing)

3. **Enemy Spawning**:
   - `EnemyManager` has spawn timers ready
   - Uncomment the enemy instantiation code once Enemy.tscn exists
   - Difficulty scaling formulas are implemented

### Godot Editor Workflow

1. **Scene Structure**: Always work with the scene tree visible
2. **Node Names**: Match the `@onready` variable names in scripts
3. **Signals**: Use the "Connect" tab to wire up signals visually
4. **Testing**: Use F6 to test individual scenes, F5 for main project

## üéØ Game Design Adherence

The implementation follows the original design document:

- ‚úÖ **Core Mechanic**: Type spell names to cast (working!)
- ‚úÖ **Time Dilation**: Game slows during typing (20% speed)
- ‚úÖ **Spell Queuing**: Number keys 1-6 queue spells
- ‚úÖ **Character Length Balance**: Longer names = more power
- ‚úÖ **Difficulty Scaling**: Time-based enemy improvements
- ‚úÖ **XP System**: Level formula implemented (100 + N*25)

## üêõ Potential Issues & Solutions

### If Movement Doesn't Work:
- Check Input Map in Project Settings
- Verify WASD keys are mapped correctly
- Ensure Player script is attached to Player node

### If Spells Don't Queue:
- Check console output for "Queued spell:" messages
- Verify SpellManager is child of Game node
- Ensure `_input()` is receiving key events

### If Camera Doesn't Follow:
- Verify Camera2D is enabled in inspector
- Check that `_physics_process` is running
- Ensure player position is updating

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Enemy Limit**: Consider max enemy count (suggested: 200)
- **Projectile Pooling**: Reuse spell projectiles for performance
- **Culling**: Remove off-screen enemies and effects
- **Time Scale**: Current time dilation system is efficient

## üé® Visual Style Guidelines

- **Player**: Blue rectangle (current)
- **Enemies**: Red shapes (different shapes for types)
- **Spells**: Bright, colorful effects
- **UI**: Clean, readable fonts with good contrast
- **Background**: Dark space theme suggested

## üîÑ Testing Checklist

Before each major addition:
- [ ] Player movement responsive
- [ ] Spell typing system working
- [ ] UI elements updating correctly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Frame rate stable (60 FPS target)

## üö® IMPORTANT: What to Implement Next

**Start with creating `/scenes/Enemy.tscn`** - this will make the game immediately more interactive and fun to test!

The foundation is solid. The typing mechanic works beautifully, and the game structure is clean and extensible. Focus on getting enemies spawning and dying, then add spell effects. You're well on your way to a unique and engaging vampire survivors variant!
