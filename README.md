## üé® Design Philosophy

The typing mechanic creates a unique tension: players must balance positioning, spell selection, and typing accuracy under pressure. The time dilation during typing provides strategic depth while maintaining the frantic pace of the vampire survivors genre.

Spell character counts are carefully balanced - shorter spells (4 chars) are quick utility, while longer spells (13 chars) deliver devastating power at the cost of typing time and vulnerability.

## üèÜ Key Differentiators

1. **Novel Input Mechanic** - Typing system adds skill ceiling beyond traditional survivors games
2. **Time Dilation Strategy** - Creates micro-moments of tactical decision making
3. **Balanced Spell Design** - Character count directly correlates with power level
4. **Audio-Visual Polish** - Complete game feel with professional presentation
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Clean codebase ready for expansion
